# KarelCraft

Karel + 'MineCraft' - like environment enabled by Ursina Engine (Panda3D) 

"Karel the Robot", an educational programming language for beginners (Pattis, 1970),
remain useful for learners in programming and computational thinking. In it's most 
recent form, you can use it to learn the multi-purpose language Python that is popular 
in data science and machine learning community. On the other hand, Minecraft (by Mojang Studios) 
and other similar sandbox construction video games (e.g. Minetest) are popular to gamers 
and have built a considerable following in the community.

KarelCraft is an attempt to mix the ideas together and come up with an environment that
beginner programmers can learn fundamental programming skills, while working with an agent,
i.e. Karel, doing actions and performing decisions in a small sandbox construction setting.
